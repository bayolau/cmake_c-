# cpp_cmake_boost_bio
self-contained c++/cmake/boost infrastructure for bioinformatics projects.

```git clone --recursive <URL>``` will clone all submodules, including Boost and SeqAn, with GBs of data.

Such download can be skipped if you know what you're doing: clone without ```--recursive``` and improvise.
